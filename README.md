Little tools for converting from a DNA / RNA sequence to amino acid sequence


Current uses:

--    Determine amino acid sequence from DNA sequencing data for single protein (saves a new file with the amino acid sequence, and also prints it out just for funsies)

--    Calculate total resultant mutant protein space from single or double nucleotide mutations

--    Calculate extinction coefficient and molecular weight of a protein

--    Design forward and reverse primers for desired site-directed mutagenesis
